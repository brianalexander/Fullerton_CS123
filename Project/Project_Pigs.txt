Score: A-

The user should be able to just press the 'Enter' key alone to
continue rolling, it looks like you still need to figure that one out...

The CDie member functions in cdie.cpp don't have any function
headers. In the CPigPlayer member functions, there isn't any internal
documentation for your code. Something of this size and complexity
should really be thoroughly documented wih proper function headers and
embedded comments. Also, you're straying from the CSG, particularly
with regards to use of whitespace.

The formatting of your code is looking good, it's clean and
consistent, and the runtime behavior of your program is fine, it seems
to be doing what it's supposed to be doing.

Overall, you've done a nice job here, congratulations!
